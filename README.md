# Data Visualization

Jupyter Notebook files with .ipynb extension in a GitHub repository will be rendered as static HTML files when they are opened. The interactive features of the notebook, such as custom JavaScript plots, will not work in your repository on GitHub.
                              
  Another way to view the notebook file online is by using nbviewer utility of Project Jupyter.
